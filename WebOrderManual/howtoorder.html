                    Our Custom Cakes are completely customised based on your request and therefore we do not offer a specific cake design to immediately choose from. 
                    Instead we would like you to tell us what you want your Custom Cake to look like or even possibly share a sketch design you made. 
                    Since the range of complexity of what these Custom Cakes could be like are very wide, we do not offer a fixed price until a design of the custom cake has been made into an agreement from you and our admin. 
                    However for the most basic one we have a starting price of IDR. XXX,XXX.

                    For these two types of products we do offer a fixed price based on the one labeled in the catalogue page. 
                    Generally all simple cakes are IDR. 175.000 each and our pastries are according to the label in the catalog.
